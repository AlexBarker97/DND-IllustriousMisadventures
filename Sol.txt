The Spell Book
	A server's book - small notebook that waitors/waitresses use

Wields a trident (Trident of the Raging Solstice) - stats of a quarterstaff
	Find on ship on wall - he decides to name it this for no other reason than brass confidence
	Can get 3 fish over the stove on the trident

He has 2 familiars (only 1 at a time)
	A ginger cat named Helios	- Land
	A shimmering octopus named Apollo	- Water

	A tiny ginger cat sits perched on the handrail, balancing impeccably, (taffrail) with fur the color of a sunrise, impossibly soft and flowing like flames. You see it's emerald eyes, wide and curious, looking out the group.

Brews ales with magical properties, prefers sun/heat based magic.

What is his wish that he is chasing:
	Create the perfect cookbook.

Personality
	Full of pride and his confidence rarely falters
	Consumes copious amount of alcohol and other alchemical drinks
		Always sipping at various experimental drinks and potions (flavour not of any use)
		Usually serves food to others, occassionally offers his brews aswell?
	Takes an inhuman amount to get him drunk
	He is very comfortable trading in markets and travelling the seas
		Bonded to Barkeeps, Innkeepers and such for giving a helping hand and often copious consumption of their alcohol earning them great profits.

	Will always try to do the right thing
	My friends are my crew; we sink or float together.
	Rich folk don't know the satisfaction of hard work.
	I laugh heartily, feel deeply, and fear nothing.
	I work hard; nature offers no handouts.
	I dislike bargaining; state your price and mean it.
	Good people make even the longest voyage bearable.
	Do not fish the same spot twice in a row; suppress your greed, and nature will reward you.
	No wave can move a soul hard at work.
	I become depressed and anxious if I'm away from the sea too long.

Background
	Fisher
		Harvest the Water
			You gain advantage on ability checks made using fishing tackle. If you have access to a body of water that sustains marine life, you can maintain a moderate lifestyle while working as a fisher, and you can catch enough food to feed yourself and up to ten other people each day.
		Fishing Tale
			You can tell a compelling tale, whether tall or true, to impress and entertain others. Once a day, you can tell your story to willing listeners. At the DM's discretion, a number of those listeners become friendly toward you; this is not a magical effect, and continued amicability on their part depends on your actions. 

		Comes from a large trading port and has lived on or around boats for most of his life.
		He noticed the giant lack of good scran on ships and found a massive gap in the market serving incredible food and booze to sailors and pirates as they travelled.
		As he travelled he also begins experimenting with not just boozes but alchemical potions with arcane spells.

/// INTRO ///
/////////////

The Messy Peacock is quiet today. You have been coming here frequently in the last few weeks, hoping to find passage on a ship as a chef, longing for the feel of the open sea. Although you have easily ingratiated yourself with the locals, laughing and shaking hands as you enter, you feel a sense of frustration at the back of your mind. It has been close to a month and still you have not been able to find a worthy sea captain.
The tavern is dark, dingy, lit by the glow of a hearth in the corner, but signs of wear are everywhere. Spider's webs nestle in the corners of the ceiling, and dirt is swept into piles underfoot. The other inhabitants of the inn are working men, for the most part, split off into groups and staring into glasses. You catch the eye of a newcomer, an old man wearing a curious suit of armour that seems to be moulded to his body. He sees you staring, and nods. You nod back, bemused by his big smile, and turn your attention back to the conversations about you, hoping to hear something about a new ship.
As you contemplate, lost in thought and excited for the future, you hear the door slam open. Looking up, you are taken aback as one by one, fierce looking men with cutlasses and pistols shove their way inside. The tavern falls silent, and every eye turns towards the door as entering, with a curious limping gait, a short man with an eye-patch and a scowl walks in. He smirks, showing disgusting yellow teeth, some of which have clearly rotted and fallen out, and surveys the room.
"Need me some hostages!" He announces to the world, and motions towards the scowling, grim workers. "Just need three of ya's." His grimace widens as he sees the barmaid, hiding behind the wooden counter. "Ye'll do, me pretty."
You wait, watch to see what will happen, restless magic lurking at your fingertips, when suddenly the old man stands up.
"I volunteer!" He shouts, and the room stirs in shock.
You feel a big smile come across your face. Here is someone who is not afraid! Standing up, you roar "Good show my friend! I will join you! Are we not enough for you, pirate?"
You eyeball the pirate captain, standing a full head and a half taller than him, and you see him shrink back in nervousness for a second, before his braggardly exterior returns. "Me name be Captain Groggo, and ye will not forget that" he says menacingly. You are already formulating a plan to save the maid, who is screaming as they carry her out, as they tie your hands together.
While this happens, you hear a shout from the kitchen. "Oi cap'n! They got one of 'em automationtoms things! Shall we's bring it?"
You hear a brief movement, then a loud clank, and four pirates emerge from the kitchen, carrying a limp automaton with them. Groggo turns to one of his men. "Bunch of freaks in this place. Sooner we get on the sea the better".
He turns to you and grins his horrible grin. "You've volunteered to be sea monster bait, you stupid peasants. Enjoy your last moments while you can." He winks at you, and motions to his crew, who push all three of you outside.
As you walk towards the pirate's ship, being shoved and cursed at, you nudge the barmaid, and barely whisper "be ready" into her ear. She stops struggling slightly, and seems to nod. You turn to the old man. "Time is running out, brave man. Tell me, can you cause a distraction?"
"Just give me a signal" he replies, staring straight ahead.
"Three... two... one," you count, and on "one", there is a huge explosion of colour and sound as chaos erupts around you, sparkling lights dazzle everyone, and pirates, blinded, curse and push into each other. Wasting no time, you summon the essence of fire into your hands, the first trick the chef learns, and burn the ropes around the maid's hand to a cinder.
Untethered, she leaps like a gazelle and sprints away from you, screaming as she goes. A pirate draws his cutlass and dashes after her, but you stick your foot out and he goes down in a heap, covered in dirt. The captain spits as he regains his bearings, and turns to his crew.
"Leave the girl!" He shouts, enraged. "Take these idiots and throw them into the hold! I'll deal with them later!"
You smile, but it is quickly wiped from your face as a the man you tripped leers in your face and smacks you with the hilt of his cutlass. Others join the beating as you fall, and you slip into unconsciousness.

Intro (NOT COMPLETE)
	Sol, is a 6ft 2 towering chef who commands both kitchen and the flames that feed it.
	Sol stands with an unshakable confidence. His skin pale blue of a glacier at dusk, held the faintest shimmer, hinting at the magic coursing through him. A mane of fiery red hair, the color of a perfectly seared steak, framed his face, each strand seemingly alive with the flickering heat of his magic.
