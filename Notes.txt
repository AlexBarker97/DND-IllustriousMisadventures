	Descriptions
		As Sol steps up to the 



Sol, Aglow with an aura of enchanting heat, the magical chef ignites the hearth. Flames dance to their command, a fiery ballet conducted with a flick of the wrist. With a flourish, they unveil the day's bounty - a glistening fish, its scales shimmering like scattered opals, its flesh hinting at the sweet kiss of the ocean. First, the chef seasons the fish with a touch of fire itself, a sprinkle of shimmering embers that leave a smoky perfume on its pristine surface.

Next, they wield a hefty knife, the glint of metal mirroring the dancing flames. With practiced ease, they halve plump potatoes, their skin earthy and taut, revealing creamy flesh that gleams like polished pearls. These treasures are tossed into the fire, anointed with a generous knob of butter that sizzles like a celebratory fanfare. Leeks, with verdant stalks that whisper of hidden meadows, are sliced with a whisper. Their vibrant green batons are then sent to join the potatoes, their delicate fragrance mingling with the smoky char of the embers.

Onions, imbued with a mysterious pungency, are then diced with fiery precision. Each cube explodes with an invisible energy as it meets the hot iron skillet, their pearly white flesh quickly turning translucent with a satisfying sizzle. Peppers, a symphony of reds and yellows, bulge with the promise of crisp summer sunshine. The chef, with a flick of their wrist, sends a burst of flame towards them, their skins charring slightly before being added to the sizzling pan. The vibrant colors deepen, their sweetness mingling with the smoky essence of the fire.



With a flourish of olive oil Sol paints the sizzling hot pan, sending a fragrant mist into the air.
		


		A sprinkle of smoked paprika adds a wisp of campfire magic, the aroma swirling around the eager diners.
		A satisfied nod is given from towards onlookers as the fire flares-up directly from. Sol, the Sunlit Chef
