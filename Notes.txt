Unique Ability: 
The Chef's Mastery:
From many years of working with fire and heat, you have learned control over the most volatile element. You gain a number of Chef Points equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended points on a long rest.
By expending a point when using a spell you may do one of the following:
Roll an extra 1d6 fire damage to the spell's damage (You must announce this before you make the attack roll)
Wreath yourself in smoke, giving you +1 AC until the start of your next turn
You may also expend a point to bathe yourself in a fiery light, giving you +2 to persuasion and intimidation for one minute.



The Messy Peacock is quiet today. You have been coming here frequently in the last few weeks, hoping to find passage on a ship as a chef, longing for the feel of the open sea. Although you have easily ingratiated yourself with the locals, laughing and shaking hands as you enter, you feel a sense of frustration at the back of your mind. It has been close to a month and still you have not been able to find a worthy sea captain.
The tavern is dark, dingy, lit by the glow of a hearth in the corner, but signs of wear are everywhere. Spider's webs nestle in the corners of the ceiling, and dirt is swept into piles underfoot. The other inhabitants of the inn are working men, for the most part, split off into groups and staring into glasses. You catch the eye of a newcomer, an old man wearing a curious suit of armour that seems to be moulded to his body. He sees you staring, and nods. You nod back, bemused by his big smile, and turn your attention back to the conversations about you, hoping to hear something about a new ship.
As you contemplate, lost in thought and excited for the future, you hear the door slam open. Looking up, you are taken aback as one by one, fierce looking men with cutlasses and pistols shove their way inside. The tavern falls silent, and every eye turns towards the door as entering, with a curious limping gait, a short man with an eye-patch and a scowl walks in. He smirks, showing disgusting yellow teeth, some of which have clearly rotted and fallen out, and surveys the room.
"Need me some hostages!" He announces to the world, and motions towards the scowling, grim workers. "Just need three of ya's." His grimace widens as he sees the barmaid, hiding behind the wooden counter. "Ye'll do, me pretty."
You wait, watch to see what will happen, restless magic lurking at your fingertips, when suddenly the old man stands up.
"I volunteer!" He shouts, and the room stirs in shock.
You feel a big smile come across your face. Here is someone who is not afraid! Standing up, you roar "Good show my friend! I will join you! Are we not enough for you, pirate?"
You eyeball the pirate captain, standing a full head and a half taller than him, and you see him shrink back in nervousness for a second, before his braggardly exterior returns. "Me name be Captain Groggo, and ye will not forget that" he says menacingly. You are already formulating a plan to save the maid, who is screaming as they carry her out, as they tie your hands together.
While this happens, you hear a shout from the kitchen. "Oi cap'n! They got one of 'em automationtoms things! Shall we's bring it?"
You hear a brief movement, then a loud clank, and four pirates emerge from the kitchen, carrying a limp automaton with them. Groggo turns to one of his men. "Bunch of freaks in this place. Sooner we get on the sea the better".
He turns to you and grins his horrible grin. "You've volunteered to be sea monster bait, you stupid peasants. Enjoy your last moments while you can." He winks at you, and motions to his crew, who push all three of you outside.
As you walk towards the pirate's ship, being shoved and cursed at, you nudge the barmaid, and barely whisper "be ready" into her ear. She stops struggling slightly, and seems to nod. You turn to the old man. "Time is running out, brave man. Tell me, can you cause a distraction?"
"Just give me a signal" he replies, staring straight ahead.
"Three... two... one," you count, and on "one", there is a huge explosion of colour and sound as chaos erupts around you, sparkling lights dazzle everyone, and pirates, blinded, curse and push into each other. Wasting no time, you summon the essence of fire into your hands, the first trick the chef learns, and burn the ropes around the maid's hand to a cinder.
Untethered, she leaps like a gazelle and sprints away from you, screaming as she goes. A pirate draws his cutlass and dashes after her, but you stick your foot out and he goes down in a heap, covered in dirt. The captain spits as he regains his bearings, and turns to his crew.
"Leave the girl!" He shouts, enraged. "Take these idiots and throw them into the hold! I'll deal with them later!"
You smile, but it is quickly wiped from your face as a the man you tripped leers in your face and smacks you with the hilt of his cutlass. Others join the beating as you fall, and you slip into unconsciousness.
