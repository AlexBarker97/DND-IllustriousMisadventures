	Descriptions
		Sol steps to the table, a light-hearted confidence across his face, his skin already eminating glowing ambers.
		
		Sol begins by igniting the small hearth, with a flick of his wrist flames jump to life and begin to dancing to his command, his bright eyes reflect the same heat back.

		With a flourish of olive oil Sol paints the sizzling hot pan, sending a fragrant mist into the air.
		
		With a swift flourish, Sol unveils the day's bounty - a glistening fish, its scales shimmering like bright opals, its skin still fragrant from salty ocean kisses. To its side are a selection of potatoes, greens, onions and peppers.
		
		Silently and peacefully Sols large hands move like silken sails in the breeze as he seasons the fish with gathered herbs and spices from his pouch. Topping it with a touch of fire itself, a sprinkle of shimmering embers crack beteen his fingers leaving a smoky perfume on the fish's surface.

		Sol gently lays the fish onto a cooking platter, using his innate Triton powers to create a hot steam cloud surrounding it and then covers as if hiding a precious artifact.

		Next, Sol lifts a hefty knife, testing its balance, the glint of metal mirroring the dancing flames. With practiced ease, he halves the plump potatoes, revealing creamy flesh that gleams like polished pearls. These treasures are tossed into the skillet, anointed with butter that sizzles like a celebratory fanfare.

		Leeks, with lushous stalks that whisper of hidden meadows, are sliced cleanly. Their vibrant green batons are then sent to join the potatoes, their delicate fragrance mingling with the smoky char.

		Onions are rolled to the center of the table, as he does so you see the hard skin loosening and with the knife he smoothly separates the fresh insides. In a rapid moment of passion Sol dices the onions with fiery precision. Each cube explodes with an invisible aroma as it meets the hot skillet, their pearly white flesh quickly turning translucent, caramelising peacefully.

		Peppers, a symphony of reds and yellows, bulge with the promise of crisp summer sunshine. Sol, makes silent eye contact with those observing and without looking flicks his wrist, sending magical flames towards the peppers, charring their skin without need for a pan. The vibrant colors deepen, their sweetness bubbling within, like pockets of flavour.

		Throughout all of this, his artifact has been reaching supremacy, he reveals the hidden fish for all to see, now steamed to a delicate flaky perfection worthy as food to the gods he thinks to himself.

		Sol one-by-one gathers first the graceful fish, then the plump potatoes, then the vibrant leeks, then the caramelised onions, the the pepper pods, before giving all one final garnish bringing them together with a paprika like campfire magic, the aroma swirling around the room.

		In one final display of showvoting Sol, the Sunlit Chef.. in one action manipulating the flames around him, extinguishes the hearth and his own embers now turn to flames as if he has engulfed the hearth's energy.
