MEAL 1 - Dawn Lobster Banquet
	Desc: Lobster with Special Seaweed, Kelp and Zest to stave off Scurvy
	Details: A colossal lobster, its shell a spectacle of coral and blue, takes center stage, the only item on show. Sol splits the lobster open, revealing pearly flesh infused with vibrant seaweed and golden kelp. An eternal flame lies in the center smoking the lobster from the inside out. A shimmering citrus powder, a clever blend of sun-dried oranges, lemons, and pineapples, adorned the lobster, adding a burst of tang and a clever defense against scurvy.

Using the back of a spoon, he shaved off a shimmering pile of crimson flakes, the Dragon Dust, before returning the rest of the mushroom to its place of honor. The pan, already scorching hot over an open flame, sizzled as he added Whisperfish drippings and carefully placed the fish skin-down. The air shimmered with anticipation as the skin crisped to a golden brown, imbued with Flicker's fiery magic.
