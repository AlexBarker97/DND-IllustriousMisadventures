Angry
	The simmering rage of a disrespected chef is coming to a boil

Surprised
	

Defusing
	Patience, young one. The best dishes take time... and a good scorching

Missed spell
	Don't get too comfortable.. I'm just pre-heating
	Some prefer their food slow cooked...

Casting fire spell
	CRUEL SUN
	You're going to be sunny side up
	You seem a little undercooked
	Looks like someone needs a taste of my signature dish
	On the menu tonight: Roasted [Enemy Race]
	Welcome to the inferno, you overcooked excuse for an appetizer
	You, my friend, are just kindling
	Dinner and a show! Tonight's special: You, served medium rare
	Looks like someone ordered the 'Chef' special. Enjoy the burn
	Time to turn up the heat

Casting generic spell
	Don't worry, this dish is complimentary...
	This dish dances on the edge, a taste both tempting and utterly deranged
	A single bite could rewrite fate, but fear not, the flavor's worth the wait
	You should've ordered the halibut, it comes with a side of whoop-ass

Against another fire caster
	How interesting.. You are quite powerful... I would say you are second only to me.
	Cute. Now let me show you a real inferno
	This pan's seen tougher flames than your pathetic fire magic. Try harder, you ...
		Timid tea-light
		Sputtering Ember
		Dim Candle
		Flickering Candle
		Tepid Puddle

Show of Confidence
	To remain calm and collected is the earned right of the powerful.
	Pardon me, I find it irksome to be looked down upon by someone smaller, I'm sure you can appreciate my dilemma.

Taking Damage
	That massage was pretty average. Needs work.

Smoke Cloud
	You must have burnt something.
	Time for a good steaming

Melee hit
	This ain't a fish fork, ya landlubber
	Three-pronged attack! And your side dish is defeat
	This blade cuts more than vegetables. It severs the connection between arrogance and your hide
	Get a skewer-load of this

Upon Dealing devastating damage
	The only thing getting served here is a piping hot beatdown
	Bone appetit, matey

Intimidation
	You forgot your compliments to the chef
	You choose, scrambled or beaten?
	Dinner and a show! Tonight's special: You, served medium rare.
	You shall be the grease at the bottom of my pan.

Food is served
	Tonight, we feast with the otherworldly, a taste so divine, it's almost unearthly
	Each ingredient whispers with arcane power, a dish both delicious and imposing
	A flick of the wrist, a swirl of the whisk, arcane energy flows, with a magical dish
	The sauce simmers down, runes etched on the spoon, this dish is a spell, a culinary typhoon

Wind & Fire
	A strong wind carries a fire far
